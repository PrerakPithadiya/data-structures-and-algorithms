/**
 * Usage Instructions: 1. Create an instance of the Solution class. 2. Call the
 * totalNQueens method with the desired board size as the argument. 3. The
 * method will return the total number of distinct solutions for the given board
 * size.
 *
 * Example: Solution solution = new Solution(); int result =
 * solution.totalNQueens(4); System.out.println(result); // This will print the
 * number of solutions for a 4x4 board
 *
 * Note: The time complexity of this solution is O(N!), where N is the size of
 * the board. This is because in the worst case, we need to try all possible
 * combinations of queen placements. The space complexity is O(N) for the
 * recursive call stack and the boolean arrays used for tracking.
