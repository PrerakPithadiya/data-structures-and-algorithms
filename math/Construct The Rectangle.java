/*
     * Usage Instructions:
     * 1. Instantiate the Solution class.
     * 2. Call the constructRectangle method with the desired area as the argument.
     * 3. The method will return an array of two integers [L, W] representing the length and width.
     *
     * Design and Implementation:
     * - The algorithm starts with the square root of the area as the initial width.
     * - It then decrements the width until it finds a value that evenly divides the area.
     * - The length is calculated by dividing the area by the width.
     * - This approach ensures that the difference between length and width is minimized,
     *   and that length is always greater than or equal to width.
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(âˆšn), where n is the input area.
     * Space Complexity: O(1), as it uses only a constant amount of extra space.
